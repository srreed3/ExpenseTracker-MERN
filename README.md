This was a semester-long project that evolved from basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to incorporate the MERN stack. The web-based application allows users to input expenses, which are dynamically added to an expense table through GET and POST requests. A user can delete a single expense or all expenses. The pie chart and "total" are updated when a user makes any changes to the expenses. All expenses are stored in a MongoDB Atlas database. Key features include user inputs, data management, data visualization, form validation, and interactive elements. The frontend, built with React, provides an interactive UI, while the backend, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, handles expense management with RESTful API endpoints and database operations. The application ensures smooth communication, error handling, and scalability for future enhancements.
